          The follicular phase is the initial stage of the menstrual cycle,
          beginning with the start of menstruation and continuing until
          ovulation. During this phase, the pituitary gland releases
          follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), stimulating the ovaries to develop
          several follicles, each containing an immature egg. As these follicles
          grow, they release estrogen, preparing the uterine lining for a
          potential pregnancy. Ovulation occurs when one dominant follicle
          releases a mature egg, marking the transition from the follicular to
          the luteal phase.

        In the follicular phase, incorporating a balanced diet is essential to
        support the body's increased energy expenditure. Including a variety of
        nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean
        proteins, can provide essential vitamins and minerals. Foods rich in
        iron and vitamin C support overall energy levels and enhance iron
        absorption. Staying well-hydrated is important throughout the menstrual
        cycle.

        Gentle exercises such as walking or yoga can be beneficial during the
        menstrual phase to promote circulation and alleviate discomfort. While
        high-intensity workouts may be challenging, moderate-intensity
        activities can provide a sense of well-being. Listening to your body's
        signals and adjusting the intensity and duration of exercises
        accordingly is key. Yoga poses that focus on gentle stretches and
        relaxation can be particularly soothing.

        During this period of your cycle, you might notice that your skin is
        slightly more sensitive and a little more dehydrated. As your body is
        shedding its uterine lining, your skin is actually producing less oil so
        this is a great time to focus on hydration and caring for your skin in
        its most sensitive state.
