      <p>
        The luteal phase is a crucial stage in the menstrual cycle, occurring
        after ovulation and preceding menstruation. This phase typically lasts
        around 12 to 16 days and is marked by the presence of the corpus luteum,
        a temporary structure formed from the ruptured follicle that released
        the egg during ovulation. The corpus luteum plays a vital role in
        producing hormones such as progesterone, which prepares the uterine
        lining for a potential pregnancy by thickening it and making it more
        receptive to a fertilized egg. If fertilization does not occur, the
        corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a drop in progesterone levels and
        the onset of menstruation. Understanding the luteal phase is essential
        for tracking reproductive health, fertility, and optimizing family
        planning efforts.
