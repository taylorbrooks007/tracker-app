          The luteal phase is the second part of the menstrual cycle that
          happens after ovulation and before your period starts. After an egg is
          released, a structure called the corpus luteum forms and releases a
          hormone called progesterone. Progesterone helps make the lining of the
          uterus thick and ready for a possible pregnancy. If there's no
          pregnancy, the corpus luteum breaks down, progesterone levels drop,
          and the uterine lining sheds, causing your period. Some individuals
          may experience mood swings, irritability, and fatigue as a result of
          the hormonal changes during this time, contributing to the emotional
          and physical aspects of premenstrual symptoms.

        Your body is craving nutrient & calorie-dense foods to support your
        cycle. Incorporating foods rich in complex carbohydrates, such as whole
        grains, legumes, and vegetables, can help stabilize blood sugar levels
        and combat potential mood swings or energy fluctuations. Including
        sources of lean protein, like poultry, fish, or plant-based
        alternatives, aids in muscle repair and supports satiety. Healthy fats
        from sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil contribute to hormone
        synthesis and can assist in managing cravings.Cooked foods, can be more
        beneficial for those who experience digestive discomfort or bloating
        during the luteal phase. Cooking can break down certain fibers and make
        nutrients more accessible. Incorporating steamed or lightly cooked
        vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can be part of a
        well-balanced and easily digestible diet. Additionally, prioritizing
        foods high in vitamins B6 and magnesium, such as bananas, spinach, and
        nuts, may help alleviate premenstrual symptoms. Staying hydrated and
        listening to individual cravings while maintaining a balanced and varied
        diet is key during this phase.

        During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle incorporating a mix of
        exercises can be beneficial. Engaging in moderate-intensity aerobic
        activities such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming helps to maintain
        cardiovascular health while minimizing stress on the body. Additionally,
        incorporating mind-body practices like yoga or Pilates may help
        alleviate stress and promote flexibility. Tailoring the workout routine
        to individual energy levels and listening to the body's signals is
        essential during this phase, allowing for a balanced approach to fitness
        that aligns with the natural fluctuations in hormonal levels.

      <p class="luteal-info__paragraph-5">
        At the beginning of the luteal phase, progesterone levels begin rising
        which increases oil production & ultimately can lead to more breakouts.
        Using products with BHA & niacinamide can assist with reducing oil
        production. Make sure to clarify & remove any makeup or excess products
        left on your skin as these can cause further irritation. Towards the end
        of the luteal phase, estrogen levels drop which can trigger eczema and
        skin sensitivities so using fragrance free and sensitive-skin friendly
        products may be helpful at this time.
