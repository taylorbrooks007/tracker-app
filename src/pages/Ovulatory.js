          The ovulation phase is a pivotal stage in the menstrual cycle,
          occurring approximately midway through. It is marked by the release of
          a mature egg from the ovary, ready for potential fertilization. This
          release is facilitated by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH), causing
          the mature follicle to burst and release the egg. Following ovulation,
          the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, a temporary
          structure that secretes hormones, including progesterone. This surge
          in hormones during the ovulation phase prepares the uterine lining,
          making it conducive to implantation if fertilization occurs.During the
          ovulation phase, many individuals experience heightened mood and
          increased physical energy due to elevated levels of estrogen and
          luteinizing hormone.

      <p class="ovulatory-info__paragraph-2">
        During the ovulation phase, your body benefits from nutrient-dense foods
        that support your menstrual cycle. Incorporating foods rich in complex
        carbohydrates, such as whole grains, legumes, and vegetables, helps
        stabilize blood sugar levels and provides sustained energy. Including
        sources of lean protein, like poultry, fish, or plant-based
        alternatives, supports muscle repair and helps keep you feeling
        satisfied. Healthy fats from avocados, nuts, and olive oil contribute to
        hormone synthesis, aiding in the regulation of your menstrual cycle.
        While raw foods can provide essential nutrients, some may find that
        incorporating lightly cooked vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins
        is easier on the digestive system during this phase. Staying hydrated
        and paying attention to individual cravings while maintaining a
        well-balanced and varied diet can contribute to overall well-being
        during the ovulation phase.

        Symptoms include: Changes in the position and firmness of your cervix.
        Heightened sense of smell, taste or sight. Increased sex drive. Minor
        pelvic or abdominal pain known as Mittelschmerz. Light bleeding or
        spotting. Brains are best at : Elevated estrogen levels are associated
        with a more positive and sociable mood. It can enhance feelings of
        confidence, sociability, and general well-being. Additionally, increased
        estrogen can influence the brain's reward system, making social
        interactions more rewarding and enjoyable.

        The ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle is an excellent time to
        capitalize on increased energy levels. Engaging in a mix of exercises
        can be beneficial during this period. Incorporate activities like
        high-intensity interval training (HIIT), strength training, or even more
        intense aerobic exercises. These workouts can take advantage of the
        surge in energy and enhance overall strength and endurance.
        Additionally, activities like dance or group classes can add a social
        and enjoyable element to your fitness routine during the ovulatory
        phase.

      <p class="ovulatory-info__paragraph-5">
        As progesterone levels increase during the ovulatory phase, there may be
        a rise in oil production, making the skin more prone to breakouts.
        Utilizing skincare products with ingredients like Beta Hydroxy Acid
        (BHA) and niacinamide can be beneficial in controlling excess oil and
        preventing breakouts. Ensure thorough cleansing to remove makeup and
        excess products, reducing the risk of skin irritation. Towards the end
        of the ovulatory phase, as estrogen levels begin to decrease, it's
        essential to pay attention to potential skin sensitivities. Opt for
        fragrance-free and sensitive-skin friendly products to support your
        skin's health during this hormonal shift. Adequate hydration and sun
        protection should remain integral parts of your skincare routine
        throughout the ovulatory phase.
