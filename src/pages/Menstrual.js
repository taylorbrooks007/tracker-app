          The menstrual phase marks the beginning of the menstrual cycle and
          occurs when the uterine lining, which was prepared for pregnancy
          during the luteal phase, is shed if no pregnancy occurs. This shedding
          results in menstrual bleeding. Hormone levels, including estrogen and
          progesterone, are at their lowest, and the body prepares for the start
          of a new reproductive cycle. This phase typically lasts around 3-7
          days, with variations among individuals.

        During the menstrual phase, the body may benefit from foods rich in iron
        to replenish any loss due to menstruation. Including iron-rich foods
        such as leafy greens, beans, and lean meats can help support energy
        levels. Adequate hydration is crucial to compensate for fluid loss
        during menstruation. Consuming foods high in vitamin C can enhance iron
        absorption. Additionally, incorporating magnesium-rich foods, like nuts
        and whole grains, may help alleviate menstrual cramps.

        Gentle exercises such as walking or yoga can be beneficial during the
        menstrual phase to promote circulation and alleviate discomfort. While
        high-intensity workouts may be challenging, moderate-intensity
        activities can provide a sense of well-being. Listening to your body's
        signals and adjusting the intensity and duration of exercises
        accordingly is key. Yoga poses that focus on gentle stretches and
        relaxation can be particularly soothing.

        During this period of your cycle, you might notice that your skin is
        slightly more sensitive and a little more dehydrated. As your body is
        shedding its uterine lining, your skin is actually producing less oil so
        this is a great time to focus on hydration and caring for your skin in
        its most sensitive state.
