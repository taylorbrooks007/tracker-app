          The menstrual phase marks the beginning of the menstrual cycle and
          occurs when the uterine lining, which was prepared for pregnancy
          during the luteal phase, is shed if no pregnancy occurs. This shedding
          results in menstrual bleeding. Hormone levels, including estrogen and
          progesterone, are at their lowest, and the body prepares for the start
          of a new reproductive cycle. This phase typically lasts around 3-7
          days, with variations among individuals.

          During the menstrual phase, the body may benefit from foods rich in
          iron to replenish any loss due to menstruation. Including iron-rich
          foods such as leafy greens, beans, and lean meats can help support
          energy levels. Adequate hydration is crucial to compensate for fluid
          loss during menstruation. Consuming foods high in vitamin C can
          enhance iron absorption. Additionally, incorporating magnesium-rich
          foods, like nuts and whole grains, may help alleviate menstrual
          cramps.

          Gentle exercises such as walking or yoga can be beneficial during the
          menstrual phase to promote circulation and alleviate discomfort. While
          high-intensity workouts may be challenging, moderate-intensity
          activities can provide a sense of well-being. Listening to your body's
          signals and adjusting the intensity and duration of exercises
          accordingly is key. Yoga poses that focus on gentle stretches and
          relaxation can be particularly soothing.

          During this period of your cycle, you might notice that your skin is
          slightly more sensitive and a little more dehydrated. As your body is
          shedding its uterine lining, your skin is actually producing less oil
          so this is a great time to focus on hydration and caring for your skin
          in its most sensitive state.
